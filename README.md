# The Government of New South Wales - Data Analysis

## Background

The NSW Public Service Commission collects data about the public sector workforce in the Workforce Profile, a census of the NSW public sector workforce.

As an analyst, my responsibility is to provide analysis of this data in different areas such as employment arrangements, age profile and diversity profile of the workforce to support policy development.

## Task

To prepare analysis on part-time employees to brief the Director prior to a meeting they are attending with the Workforce Diversity Steering Committee to review whether part-time employment arrangements are increasing.

**To provide:**

- Trends over time in male and female employment, including any notable changes

- The current representation of part time employees in the sector and in each Cluster

- The current representation of male and female part time employees as a proportion of the respective male and the female workforce in the sector and in each cluster

- Change in these two above statistics over the last 4 years

- Projection of what the representation will be by 2025 if the current trends continue

## Output

Prepared a discussion paper of the analysis that would be suitable for a Director to use as a discussion aid in a meeting with senior executives. The discussion paper includes tables and charts that illustrate the findings.
